          A flood is the overflowing of the normal confines of a stream or other body of 
          water, or the accumulation of water over areas that are not normally submerged. 
          Floods can occur nearly anywhere on Earth; in any place that rain can fall, floods 
          can occur.

              - Flooding is caused by the overÂ­flowing of rivers and lakes; by serious breaks 
              in dikes, levees, dams and other protective structures; by uncontrollable

            <div class="tab-content">
              - Flash floods develop in hilly and mountainous terrains where the slope of the 
              river is rather steep. The rapid development of the flood is due to the 
              extremely short concentration time of the drainage catchment. This means that 
              precipitation falling on a point in the catchment farthest from the river 
              takes only a short time to reach the river channel and become part of 
              streamflow. Thus, the amount of streamflow rapidly increases and, consequently, 
              the rise in water level. When the flow capacity of the stream is exceeded, 
              the channel overflows and the result is a flash flood.
