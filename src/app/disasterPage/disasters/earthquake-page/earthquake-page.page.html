        <p>An <b>earthquake</b> is a weak to violent shaking of the ground produced by the 
          sudden movement of rock materials below the earthâ€™s surface.
          The earthquakes originate in tectonic plate boundary. The focus is point inside 
          the earth where the earthquake started, sometimes called the <b>hypocenter</b>, and the 
          point on the surface of the earth directly above the focus is called the 
          <b>epicenter</b>.

            <div class="tab-content">
              There are two ways by which we can measure the strength of an earthquake: 
              <b>Magnitude</b> and <b>Intensity</b>.
            </div>

            <div class="tab-content">
              <b>Magnitude</b> is proportional to the energy released by an earthquake at the focus. 
              It is calculated from earthquakes recorded by an instrument called seismograph. 
              It is represented by Arabic Numbers (e.g. 4.8, 9.0). 
            </div>

            <div class="tab-content">
              <b>Intensity</b> on the other hand, is the strength of an earthquake as perceived and felt by people in a 
              certain locality. It is a numerical rating based on the relative effects to 
              people, objects, environment, and structures in the surrounding. The intensity 
              is generally higher near the epicenter. It is represented by Roman Numerals 
              (e.g. II, IV, IX). In the Philippines, the intensity of an earthquake is 
              determined using the PHIVOLCS Earthquake Intensity Scale (PEIS).
