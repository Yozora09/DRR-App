        <p>An <b>earthquake</b> is a weak to violent shaking of the ground produced by the 
          sudden movement of rock materials below the earthâ€™s surface.
          The earthquakes originate in tectonic plate boundary. The focus is point inside 
          the earth where the earthquake started, sometimes called the <b>hypocenter</b>, and the 
          point on the surface of the earth directly above the focus is called the 
          <b>epicenter</b>.
